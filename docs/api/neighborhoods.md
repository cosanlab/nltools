(neighborhoods-neighborhoods)=
## `neighborhoods`

Spatial neighborhood computation for neuroimaging analyses.

This module provides efficient computation and caching of spatial neighborhoods
(spheres) around brain voxels. It is designed to support searchlight analyses,
ISC, and other operations that require iterating over local brain regions.

The key insight is that for a given mask and radius, the neighborhood structure
is deterministic and can be cached for reuse across analyses.

#### `SphereNeighborhoods`

```python
SphereNeighborhoods(adjacency: sparse.csr_matrix, mask_hash: str, radius_mm: float, n_voxels: int) -> None

Precomputed sphere neighborhoods for a brain mask.

This dataclass stores a sparse adjacency matrix where row i contains True
for all voxels within the specified radius of voxel i. It provides efficient
iteration over neighborhoods for searchlight-style analyses.

#### `compute_searchlight_neighborhoods`

```python
compute_searchlight_neighborhoods(mask_img: Nifti1Image, radius_mm: float = 10.0, use_cache: bool = True) -> SphereNeighborhoods
```

Compute sphere neighborhoods for all voxels in a brain mask.

For each voxel in the mask, this function identifies all other voxels
within the specified radius (in millimeters). The result is cached to
disk for fast reloading in subsequent analyses.

The algorithm uses sklearn's BallTree for efficient radius queries in
world coordinates (mm), ensuring accurate neighborhoods regardless of
voxel resolution.

**Parameters:**

Name | Type | Description | Default
---- | ---- | ----------- | -------
`mask_img` | <code>[Nifti1Image](#nibabel.Nifti1Image)</code> | NIfTI mask image defining the brain region | *required*
`radius_mm` | <code>[float](#float)</code> | Radius of spheres in millimeters (default: 10.0) | <code>10.0</code>
`use_cache` | <code>[bool](#bool)</code> | If True, cache results to ~/.nltools/cache/searchlight/ for fast reloading (default: True) | <code>True</code>

**Returns:**

Type | Description
---- | -----------
<code>[SphereNeighborhoods](#nltools.data.braindata.neighborhoods.SphereNeighborhoods)</code> | SphereNeighborhoods with precomputed adjacency matrix
