        "\nDesign Matrix\n==============\n\nThis tutorial illustrates how to use the Design_Matrix class to flexibly create design matrices that can then be used with the Brain_Data class to perform univariate regression.\n\nDesign Matrices can be thought of as \"enhanced\" pandas dataframes; they can do everything a pandas dataframe is capable of, with some added features. Design Matrices follow a data organization format common in many machine learning applications such as the sci-kit learn API: 2d tables organized as observations by features. In the context of neuro-imaging this often translates to TRs by conditions of interest + nuisance covariates (1st level analysis), or participants by conditions/groups (2nd level analysis).\n\n\n"
